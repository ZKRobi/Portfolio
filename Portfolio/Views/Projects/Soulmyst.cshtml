        Soulmyst is an endless runner game, where the player takes control of a spirit animal, shapeshifting into different forms to pass through different obstacles.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game was created for the Ludum Dare 35 Game Jam, wich is a 72 hours event.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project was made with Unity engine. My main addition to the project was game logic programming, assembling the UI, configuring sprite animations, and testing if the game works properly.
